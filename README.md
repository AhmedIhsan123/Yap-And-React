# 💬 Yap-And-React — Real-Time Messaging App

A simple real-time chat app built with **React** and **Supabase**. Anyone with the link can send messages — including emojis — that appear live for every connected user, no page refresh needed.

Built as a demo to showcase real-time web technology.

---

## What it does

- Send messages (text, emojis, or both) that appear instantly for everyone
- Auto-assigned random username (e.g. "EpicOtter") that you can change
- Anonymous option if no name is entered
- Messages persist — new users see recent chat history on join

## How real-time works

```
User A types a message and hits Send
        ↓
React writes the message to the Supabase database
        ↓
Supabase detects the new row and broadcasts it
        ↓
Every connected user's app receives the broadcast
        ↓
React updates the screen — message appears live
```

The key is Supabase Realtime. When the app loads, it opens a persistent WebSocket connection to Supabase and subscribes to any new rows inserted into the `messages` table. No polling, no refreshing — it just listens.

## Database setup

One table in Supabase is all you need.

**Table name:** `messages`

| Column       | Type        | Notes                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`         | uuid        | Auto-generated primary key                             |
| `username`   | text        | Sender's display name                                  |
| `content`    | text        | The message content (text, emojis, or both)            |
| `sender_id`  | text        | Random ID stored in the browser to identify the sender |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Auto-set to the current time                           |

Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled with two policies:

- **Anyone can read** messages
- **Anyone can insert** messages
